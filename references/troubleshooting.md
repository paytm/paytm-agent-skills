## Initiate Transaction fails

### `resultCode: 227` - checksum mismatch
- Body bytes used to **generate** checksum must equal body bytes **sent**. Build `body` once, JSON-stringify once, hash the same string, then send that exact string.
- Don't pretty-print, re-serialize, or sort keys between hashing and sending.
- Wrong `MERCHANT_KEY` (staging key on prod host or vice versa).
- Trailing whitespace / newline in env var (`.env` files often add `\n`).
- For `verifySignature` on callbacks: pass the form params *minus* `CHECKSUMHASH` - and as the raw map, not a JSON string.

### `resultCode: 330` - invalid orderId
- `orderId` charset: alphanumerics + `_` / `@` / `-`. Avoid `.`, spaces, slashes, unicode.
- Length ≤ ~50 chars. UUIDs without hyphens or hex tokens are safe.

### `resultCode: 334` - duplicate orderId
- `orderId` already used (even for a *failed* prior attempt). Generate a fresh one for every retry; never reuse.

### `resultCode: 335` - request expired / invalid
- System clock skew on server, or stale request being retried.

### `resultCode: 400` / HTTP 400 - bad request
- Missing required field. Always include: `requestType`, `mid`, `websiteName`, `orderId`, `callbackUrl`, `txnAmount.value`, `txnAmount.currency`, `userInfo.custId`.
- `websiteName` must match the value provisioned for your MID on the dashboard (e.g. `WEBSTAGING`, `DEFAULT`, `retail`). Wrong value → silent failure or `400`.
- `txnAmount.value` must be a **string**, two-decimal, INR (`"1.00"`, not `1.0` or `1`).

### `resultCode: 501` / `502` / 5xx - Paytm system error
- Transient. Retry with the **same** orderId (idempotent on Paytm side until success).

### `MISSING_TXN_TOKEN`
- HTTP 200 but no `body.txnToken`. Inspect `body.resultInfo.resultMsg`. Usually a config error (websiteName / industryTypeId / channelId mismatch on dashboard).

## `Failed to parse URL from /paytm-client-config.json` (or `/paytm/create-order`)

You're calling `fetch()` with a relative or root-relative URL in a context where it's evaluated by **Node's `fetch`** (not the browser's). Node requires absolute URLs.

Where this happens:
- **Next.js / Remix / SvelteKit SSR** - the component runs server-side first.
- **React Server Components** - runs in Node.
- **Node test scripts** that import the frontend code.
- HTML opened via `file://` (relative resolves but the request fails differently).

Two fixes, pick one:

1. **Always use absolute URLs in browser-only code.** The reference frontends use `new URL("paytm/create-order", document.baseURI).toString()` - works in browser regardless of mount path, fails fast in SSR (so you know not to call it there).
2. **For SSR / Node contexts:** prepend the backend origin explicitly:
   ```js
   const base = process.env.PAYTM_BACKEND_BASE || "http://localhost:3001";
   fetch(`${base}/paytm/create-order`, { ... })
   ```
   Or move the fetch into a `useEffect` / client-only component so it never runs server-side.

Rule of thumb: any code that talks to your `/paytm/*` backend endpoints is client-side only - guard it with `"use client"` (Next.js), `onMount` (Svelte), or browser-only checks (`typeof window !== "undefined"`).

## "Pay" button does nothing - modal doesn't open on click

The most common cause is wrapping `CheckoutJS.init`/`invoke` inside `CheckoutJS.onLoad()` *inside* the click handler. `onLoad` fires once at script-load time; by the time the user clicks, it has already fired and your callback never runs.

**Fix:** Use the merchant script's `onload` (or `Paytm.CheckoutJS.onLoad` only if the script is a static `<script src=...>` tag) to enable the button at page level; call `init`/`invoke` **directly** in the click handler — never wrap them inside `Paytm.CheckoutJS.onLoad()`. Full pattern in `SKILL.md` → "Common Integration Bugs" → #3, and live code in `scripts/frontend/checkout.html`.

Other causes for the same symptom:
- Browser popup blocker - invoke must come from a real user gesture (it does, in the click handler).
- `txnToken` already used / expired - generate a fresh one for each click.
- `window.Paytm` undefined - script loader didn't finish; check Network tab for the merchant `.js` file.

---

## JS Checkout doesn't render

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `window.Paytm` undefined | Loader `<script>` not loaded - wrong MID in URL, or merchant not provisioned for CheckoutJS on that environment |
| Blank popup, immediate close | Browser blocked the popup. Use `redirect: true` or trigger from a user gesture (click handler) |
| `init` resolves but `invoke` does nothing | `txnToken` already used / expired (15-min TTL) - generate a fresh one |
| `SESSION_EXPIRED` event | `txnToken` past its 15-minute TTL - call `/paytm/create-order` again |
| Loader 403 / 404 | PG domain mismatch - check Developer Settings → API Keys on the dashboard for the correct host |
| Mixed-content blocked | Page on HTTP loading HTTPS Paytm script; serve your page over HTTPS |

---

## Callback arrives but is ignored / treated as failure

- **Callback verification is a separate scheme from API checksum.** Build a `TreeMap`/sorted dict of all POSTed params *except* `CHECKSUMHASH`, then call `PaytmChecksum.verifySignature(map, key, checksum)`.
- Field names from Paytm are uppercase (`ORDERID`, `TXNID`, `TXNAMOUNT`, `STATUS`, `RESPCODE`, `RESPMSG`, `CHECKSUMHASH`, `BANKTXNID`, `PAYMENTMODE`, `GATEWAYNAME`, `BANKNAME`, `CURRENCY`, `TXNDATE`).
- Some browsers receive the callback as **GET** (not POST) when the user hits *Back*. Implement both.
- The callback is the user's browser - **not** a webhook. It can be lost (popup blocker, network drop). Always reconcile with the Transaction Status API or the S2S webhook.

---

## Transaction Status API gives `S` / `TXN_SUCCESS` but order not delivered

- Don't trust the JS callback alone. Final source of truth: **`/v3/order/status`** server-to-server.
- Compare `TXNAMOUNT` against your stored amount before fulfilling - defends against tampered redirects.
- If `STATUS == PENDING` keep polling (typical: 30s → 2m → 5m → give up at 30m, then mark `FAILURE`).

---

## Refunds

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `refundAmount > txnAmount` rejected | Partial refunds allowed but cumulative ≤ original |
| `Duplicate refId` | `refId` is unique per refund attempt; generate fresh per call |
| Refund stuck `PENDING` | Bank-side delay, can take up to T+7 working days |

---

## Expanded RESPCODE reference

Paytm publishes an authoritative table; common ones merchants hit:

| RESPCODE | RESPMSG / Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `01` | Txn success | Fulfill order |
| `141` | User cancelled at bank page | Allow retry |
| `227` | Checksum mismatch | See "Initiate Transaction fails" above |
| `235` | Insufficient bank balance | Show retry / different payment option |
| `267` | Bank declined | Retry / switch payment option |
| `295` | Invalid card details | User error |
| `334` | Duplicate orderId | Generate new orderId |
| `335` | Request expired | New session |
| `400` | Bad request | Check field formats |
| `401` | Unauthorized | MID/key mismatch |
| `402` | Pending - awaiting bank | Poll Transaction Status |
| `501` | System error | Retry |
| `810` | Risk system declined | Contact Paytm support |
| `911` / `BANK_PENDING` | Bank confirmation pending | Poll, do not refund |

For unfamiliar codes: query Transaction Status API with the orderId - `body.resultInfo.resultMsg` is the canonical explanation. Full list: <https://www.paytmpayments.com/docs/response-codes>.

## Corp proxy TLS interception (`UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`)

Symptom: Node `fetch` to `https://secure.paytmpayments.com` (prod) fails with `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`, `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`, or `unable to verify the first certificate`. Staging (`securestage.paytmpayments.com`) often works because many corp proxies exempt non-prod hosts from TLS inspection.

Cause: A corporate proxy (Zscaler / Netskope / Palo Alto / BlueCoat / etc.) is doing TLS interception - it terminates the TLS connection, re-signs the response with an internal CA, and forwards it to your machine. Your OS keychain trusts that internal CA, but Node / Python / Java each ship their own CA bundle and don't pick it up automatically.

### Fix 1 (recommended): Trust the corp CA in your runtime

Extract the corp root cert, then point your runtime at it. TLS verification stays ON.

**macOS** - export from System keychain:
```bash
mkdir -p ./certs
security find-certificate -a -p /Library/Keychains/System.keychain > ./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt
# Or just the corp root if you know its CN:
security find-certificate -a -c "YourCorpName Root CA" -p \
  /Library/Keychains/System.keychain > ./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt
```

**Linux** - usually already in the system bundle:
```bash
cp /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt ./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt
# Debian/Ubuntu: corp certs land in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ after `update-ca-certificates`
```

**Windows (PowerShell, admin)**:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\Root |
  Where-Object Subject -match "YourCorpName" |
  Export-Certificate -FilePath .\certs\corp-proxy-ca.crt -Type CERT
```

**Pull what the proxy is actually serving** (works on any OS with openssl):
```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect secure.paytmpayments.com:443 </dev/null \
  2>/dev/null | sed -n '/BEGIN CERT/,/END CERT/p' > ./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt
```

Then per runtime:

| Runtime | Config |
|---|---|
| Node | `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt` in `.env`, restart |
| Python (requests) | `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt` |
| Python (httpx) | `SSL_CERT_FILE=./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt` |
| Java | `keytool -import -alias corpProxy -file ./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit` |
| curl | `curl --cacert ./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt ...` |

Verify:
```bash
node -e "fetch('https://secure.paytmpayments.com').then(r=>console.log(r.status)).catch(e=>console.error(e.code))"
```
Should print a status code (e.g. `404`), not an error code.

### The asymmetric-MITM trap (the one that actually bit us)

Some corp proxies (Zscaler is the common one) intercept **staging hosts but pass production through unintercepted** - or vice versa. This produces a confusing failure mode:

| Endpoint | Proxy behavior | Chain Node sees | Trusted? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `securestage.paytmpayments.com` | MITM (re-signed with corp intermediate) | Corp-issued | Only if corp CA is trusted |
| `secure.paytmpayments.com` | Passthrough | Real DigiCert chain | Only if DigiCert root is trusted |

If your shell exports `SSL_CERT_FILE=~/zscaler-root-ca.pem` (Zscaler's installer does this), Node uses **only** that file as its trust store - DigiCert is gone. Staging works, prod fails with `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`. Same outcome on Python (`requests` honors `SSL_CERT_FILE` too).

### `SSL_CERT_FILE` vs `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` - critical distinction

| Variable | Behavior | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SSL_CERT_FILE` | **Replaces** Node's bundled trust store | Only the CAs in that file are trusted - public CAs (DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, etc.) are silently dropped |
| `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` | **Adds** to Node's bundled trust store | Public CAs still trusted, plus the extras |

Always prefer `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. If `SSL_CERT_FILE` is set in your environment (check `env | grep SSL_CERT_FILE`), unset it for the Node process:

```bash
# Correct - drops the variable entirely
env -u SSL_CERT_FILE NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt node server.js

# WRONG - empty string still tells Node "use this (empty) file as the trust store"
SSL_CERT_FILE= NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt node server.js
```

In a `package.json` script:
```json
"start": "env -u SSL_CERT_FILE NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=./certs/corp-proxy-ca.crt node server.js"
```

Python equivalent: `unset SSL_CERT_FILE REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` before running, then point `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` at a bundle that contains **both** the corp CA and the public roots (concatenate `certifi.where()` output with your corp PEM).

### Fix 2: Ask IT to bypass TLS inspection for Paytm

One-line ticket: "Please exempt `*.paytmpayments.com` from TLS inspection - payment gateway, PCI-scope traffic." Most proxies have a financial-services bypass category already.

### Fix 3: Run from outside the corp network (fastest for a demo)

- Phone hotspot - proxy isn't in the path, real Paytm chain validates, zero config.
- Cloud VM (EC2 / Render / Fly / Railway) - point your demo at that origin.
- Home network over personal VPN.

### What NOT to do

- **Do not** set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` or `rejectUnauthorized: false` with real production merchant credentials. It disables verification for *every* outbound HTTPS call in the process - any host on-path can read your `MERCHANT_KEY`.
- **Do not** set `verify=False` (Python `requests`) or trust-all `SSLContext` (Java) in prod for the same reason.
- **Do not** commit the extracted CA bundle to a public repo - it's not secret, but it leaks your employer's name and proxy vendor.

### Quick triage

```
prod TLS fails, staging works?      → corp proxy intercepting prod only → Fix 1 or 2
both fail with same cert error?     → corp proxy intercepting all → Fix 1 or 2
both fail, different errors?        → not a TLS issue → check DNS / firewall / MID env mismatch
works on hotspot, fails on wifi?    → confirmed corp-proxy MITM → Fix 1, 2, or 3
```

## Environment / config gotchas

- **PG domain.** Use `https://secure.paytmpayments.com` (prod) and `https://securestage.paytmpayments.com` (staging). The exact host provisioned for your MID is shown under Developer Settings → API Keys on the dashboard.
- **One environment per MID.** Staging MID will not authenticate against prod host (and gives `401`/checksum errors that look like a key mismatch).
- **`websiteName` is per-MID.** Defaults seen: `DEFAULT`, `WEB_STAGING`, `WEBSTAGING`, `retail`. Wrong value → `initiateTransaction` succeeds with a token that fails to render.
- **Currency is INR-only** for domestic Paytm PG. Cross-border requires a separate account.

---

## Quick decision tree

```
Payment failed?
├─ Did initiateTransaction return a txnToken?
│   ├─ No  → check resultInfo.resultMsg → see "Initiate Transaction fails"
│   └─ Yes
│       ├─ Did JS Checkout render?
│       │   ├─ No  → see "JS Checkout doesn't render"
│       │   └─ Yes
│       │       ├─ Did Paytm POST callback?
│       │       │   ├─ No  → call Transaction Status API anyway (browser issue)
│       │       │   └─ Yes
│       │       │       └─ Did CHECKSUMHASH verify?
│       │       │           ├─ No  → "Callback arrives but is ignored"
│       │       │           └─ Yes → call /v3/order/status - that is the truth
```

## Terminology rules (strict)

User-facing copy, code comments, variable names, UI labels, README steps, and chat replies must use **only** the following vocabulary when referring to payment options. No synonyms, no product names, no umbrella terms - even in passing.

**Allowed payment-option terms (use these exactly):**
- UPI
- Credit Cards
- Debit Cards
- Net Banking
- EMI

**Staging mobile / OTP credentials - what they actually are:**

The mobile + OTP values listed in `SKILL.md`'s *Test Credentials* section exist for **one purpose only**: to satisfy the OTP step inside the **card payment simulator** on staging (e.g. when the test card `4111 1111 1111 1111` triggers a 3DS / OTP prompt, enter mobile `7777777777` and OTP `489871`).

They are NOT:
- a separate payment option
- a separate Paytm product
- usable for UPI, Net Banking, EMI, or any non-card flow
- a generic "log in with mobile / OTP" credential

When generating copy that references these values, label them exactly as one of:
- "Test mobile / OTP for card simulator"
- "Card OTP credentials (staging)"
- "Staging OTP for test cards"

Do NOT relabel, repackage, or describe these credentials as anything other than card-flow OTP values. Do NOT present them as a standalone way to pay.

**UPI testing on staging:** supported only via the **Paytm staging consumer app** - not any production UPI app. The merchant requests the staging app build from their Paytm KAM / support, installs it on a test device, and uses it to scan staging QRs or open staging UPI intent links. **Collect-flow UPI is disabled on staging** - only intent / scan flows work.

Do not generate, fabricate, or example any staging UPI VPA. The only correct VPA in any generated example is the merchant's real production VPA from their dashboard.

If the user wants to test UPI without the staging app, instruct them to switch to their production MID and pay a ₹1 real amount via any production UPI app on their phone.

If the user's prompt asks for a payment-option term outside the allowed list, treat it as out of scope and ask the user to pick from the allowed list instead of generating it.
